        <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> was an Indian
          aerospace
          scientist and statesman who served as the president of India from 2002 to 2007.

          Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace engineering. He
          spent the
          next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
          Organisation
          (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space
          programme and
          military missile development efforts. He was known as the "Missile Man of India" for his work on the
          development of
          ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and
          political role
          in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the second test since the first nuclear test by India in 1974.
